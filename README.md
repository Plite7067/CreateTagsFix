# CreateCCModemFix/TagsFix
Fixes various blocks on create contraptions.
This works by adding tags to modded, ~~and some vanilla blocks~~(fixed by create before 1.21.1 iirc). Check out createccfix/data/create/tags/blocks/ for a list of tags. The tags are the file names.\
The fix for the original problem was suggested by the author of this [issue](https://github.com/tweaked-programs/cccbridge/issues/82), and now the project has expanded to adding tags to any blocks that need a create tag.

Both the createccfix folder and zip work as datapacks - you just need to install it using your preferred method of installing datapacks into your saves/world/datapack directory.

Supported Blocks as of 1.21.1:\
supplementaries candle holders

Blocks that were supported before 1.21.1, but were fixed in respective mods, and have therefore been removed from this datapack:\
computercraft modems\
vanilla moss carpet\
vanilla banners\
vanilla cake

If you have any issues or ideas for improvement, create an issue.

If you have other blocks that have the same problem, please comment on the issue.

Modrinth - also has the datapack packaged as a fabric and forge mod for ease of use:
